Generate the following two result sets:

Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in OCCUPATIONS, immediately followed by the first letter of each profession as a parenthetical (i.e.: enclosed in parentheses). For example: AnActorName(A), ADoctorName(D), AProfessorName(P), and ASingerName(S).
Query the number of ocurrences of each occupation in OCCUPATIONS. Sort the occurrences in ascending order, and output them in the following format:

There are a number of people who will be attending ACM-ICPC World Finals. Each of them may be well versed in a number of topics. Given a list of topics known by each attendee, you must determine the maximum number of topics a 2-person team can know. Also find out how many ways a team can be formed to know that many topics. Lists will be in the form of bit strings, where each string represents an attendee and each position in that string represents a field of knowledge, 1 if its a known field or 0 if not.

Input Format

The first line contains two integers, N and M, separated by a single space, where N represents the number of attendees and M represents the number of topics. N lines follow.
Each line contains a binary string of length M. If the ith line's jth character is 1, then the ith person knows the jth topic; otherwise, he doesn't know the topic.

Output Format

On the first line, print the maximum number of topics a 2-person team can know.
On the second line, print the number of ways to form a 2-person team that knows the maximum number of topics.
